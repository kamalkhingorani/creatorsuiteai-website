            <div class="p-4 bg-yellow-900/10 border border-yellow-500/20 rounded-lg text-sm mb-6">
                <strong>Notice:</strong> By using this App, you agree to the following strictly enforced terms.
            </div>

            <div class="space-y-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
                <p><strong>1. Nature of Service (The 'Tool' Clause)</strong><br>
                CreatorSuite is an AI-powered software tool for information purposes only. We are NOT a law firm. The documents generated are drafts/templates and do not constitute legal advice.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Global Compliance</strong><br>
                You agree to comply with all applicable local, state, and international laws. You are solely responsible for ensuring that any content generated via this App complies with the laws of your specific region.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Limitation of Liability</strong><br>
                To the maximum extent permitted by law, CreatorCanvas, its Proprietor (Owner), and Affiliates shall NOT be liable for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages arising from errors, omissions, or missing clauses in generated documents. Total liability is limited to fees paid by you in the last 12 months.</p>
                
                <p><strong>4. Indemnification</strong><br>
                You agree to indemnify and hold CreatorCanvas, its Proprietor (Owner) and Affiliates harmless from any claims resulting from your use of the generated documents.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Pricing & Subscription Terms</strong><br>
                Since our services rely on third-party AI infrastructure costs, pricing is subject to change without prior notice. However, any active subscription will be honored at its original rate until the end of the current billing cycle. Future renewals and new subscriptions will be charged at the rates effective at the time of payment.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Third-Party Disputes & No Recourse</strong><br>
                - <strong>Sole Liability:</strong> In the event of any legal action between You and any Third Party arising from a document generated by this App, You shall be the sole party liable.<br>
                - <strong>No Recourse:</strong> You explicitly waive any right to seek compensation or contribution from CreatorSuite.</p>

                <p><strong>7. AI Unpredictability & Technical Malfunction (CRITICAL)</strong><br>
                - <strong>No Malicious Intent:</strong> You acknowledge that the App is designed with positive intent. However, Artificial Intelligence is inherently probabilistic and may occasionally produce "hallucinations," errors, or unintended outputs ("Misbehavior").<br>
                - <strong>Assumption of Risk:</strong> You accept that any such "misbehavior," omission, or commission by the App is a technical limitation of AI technology, not a malicious act by the Developer.<br>
                - <strong>Total Waiver:</strong> You agree that the Developer shall bear NO LIABILITY for any actions taken by you based on such unintended App behavior. You are solely responsible for verifying all outputs.</p>

                <p><strong>8. Refund Policy & Account Suspension</strong><br>
                - <strong>Termination for Breach:</strong> We reserve the right to ban or suspend any account found violating these Terms, including generating illegal content, abusing the referral system, or attempting to reverse-engineer the platform.<br>
                - <strong>Effect of Ban:</strong> If your account is banned for a violation of these Terms, you forfeit all remaining subscription time and credits.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Digital Product Nature</strong><br>
                CreatorSuite AI provides non-tangible, irrevocable digital subscriptions. Once a subscription is activated and credits are issued to your account, the product is considered "consumed."</p>
            
                <p><strong>2. Technical Failure & Activation Guarantee</strong><br>
                If your payment is successful but the subscription is not activated due to a system error, our first priority is to <strong>manually activate your plan</strong> within 24 hours of notification. If we are unable to resolve the activation within 5 business days, a full refund will be issued to your original payment method.</p>
            
                <p><strong>3. Duplicate Charges</strong><br>
                In the event of accidental double-billing for the same period, the second charge will be refunded within 5-7 business days upon verification.</p>
